This repo serves as a testing ground for message passing. One issue I forsee with some of the webapps I'd like to try to develop is a way of easily handling "long" running calculations and message passing seems to be the best bet. 

Likewise, this would also allow for a better balance for a headnode that had more memory for better I/O and worker nodes with more powerful CPU's for calculations.
